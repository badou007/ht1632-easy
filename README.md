ht1632-easy
===========
see the result at http://youtu.be/fplK7FjgmwI

to use the code beware the #defines at the beginning to correctly connect the master to the atmega16 .
on sure electronic cable cs2,cs1,wr and data are in this order on the side of the the "d√©trompeur" ,cs2 at the top near the red line and cs2 first .after cs2 on the other side are cs3 and cs4 with cs3 at the top .
there lot of explanations to help beginner to understand what is going .
it's strongly recommanded to read carefully the datasheet from Holtek , this helps you tounderstand what is going .

writing to each panel uses the continuous writing mode . I use a matrix J1[96] that I share in 3 parties: from 0 to 31 , from 31 to 63 and from 64 to 95 .

you can modify the code to connect 4 pannels : simply modify the J1[96] TO J1[128],add annother function affiche3 for the forth pannel , modify the functions affiche : the first from 0 to 31 , second from 32 to 63, 3eme from 64 to 95 and the master from 96 to 127 ; add functions c3_hight() and cs3_low() following the cs3 PIN , modify the ht1632_command1 to take acount of the forth panel and add |(1<<cs3) to ht1632_data_dir|=(1<<cs)|(1<<data)|(1<<wr)|(1<<cs1)|(1<<cs2) in the int() function ; I believe it's all ; 
now remark that achieving to drive 3 pannels the same program can drive 1 or 2 pannels ; the same for dring 4 panels allows to drive 1 or 2 or 3 panels .

OK!!
